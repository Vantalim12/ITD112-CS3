**Your** **journal** **should** **follow** **a** **structured**
**format** **with** **the** **following** **sections:**

**Abstract**

> Summarize your entire study in 150–250 words.
>
> Must include:
>
> ● Purpose of the system/project
>
> ● Methods (Firebase, React, visualization techniques) ● Key
> ﬁndings/insights from data
>
> ● Implications or importance of the visualization output

**1** **Introduction**

> ● Provide background on Filipino emigration trends.
>
> ● Discuss the importance of data visualization in understanding
> population mobility.
>
> ● State the purpose of your web application. ● Clearly present:
>
> ○ Research problem or question ○ Objectives of the study
>
> ○ Signiﬁcance (who will beneﬁt from this visualization system)

**2** **Methodology**

Explain your development process clearly and technically:

> **2.1** **System** **Architecture**
>
> ● Describe Firebase backend conﬁguration, Firestore setup, and data
> structure. ● Explain how React and Firebase were integrated.
>
> **2.2** **Data** **Preparation**
>
> ● Source of Filipino Emigrants dataset
>
> ● Fields used: year, single, married, widower, separated, divorced,
> notReported, etc.
>
> ● Data uploading process into Firebase (manual or via CSV upload)
>
> **2.3** **Visualization** **Tools** **&** **Techniques**
>
> ● State the libraries used (e.g., Recharts).
>
> ● Identify which chart type was used per visualization objective

**3** **Results** **and** **Discussion**

> (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION)
>
> ● Present each graph/chart and interpret what the data means. ● For
> each visualization:
>
> ○ Insert chart image/screenshot (with label and ﬁgure number) ○
> Explain trends, patterns, and insights
>
> ○ Discuss what the visualization reveals about Filipino emigrants
> (e.g., which civil status trends are increasing, relationship between
> year and number of emigrants)
>
> ● Highlight implications or potential policy/research recommendations
> based on data.

**4** **Conclusion** **and** **Recommendations** ● Summarize your
ﬁndings.

> ● State how the use of Firebase and visualization tools helped in
> data-driven insight discovery.
>
> ● Mention any limitations.
>
> ● Provide recommendations or suggestions for improvement (technical or
> analytical).
